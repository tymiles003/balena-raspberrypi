      hash: a5c68388be4e1199f49daddef330fafe1e73522b
      body: |
        By default this comes enabled from
        meta-balena, but none of the raspberrypi
        machines generate a flasher image.

        Disabling this allows for adding usb to
        resin_uboot_device_types without actually
        starting usb, unless it is confirmed that
        there's no balena image on the sd-card.

        Kernel update uncovered an issue with modules
        being loaded from the new os container during hup.
        Loading modules with a new version from the new OS
        will trigger failure of the hup hook.

        Disable this hook temporarily so we can fix
        the issues we uncovered during release testing.

        If a framebuffer console is used with the
        Sensehat's 8x8 display framebuffer, various
        issues will appear when attempting to draw
        images on it.

        This small display is not meant for console,
        therefore fbcon should not takeover the fb
        created by its' driver.

        This issue does not occurr if another
        framebuffer is already present and used,
        as console is not switched to the new one.

                Customers usually don't need this delay during u-boot. Also in
                some

                cases, hardware attached on the uart pins might pause uboot
                preventing

                customers from using dev images easily.


                But we do need this delay during our development work on bsps
                etc.


                Lets make this autoboot delay build time configurable


                Also make the BOOTDELAY -2 which is better than 0 as that
                completely

                prevents any char on serial from interrupting boot.

                PR #1441 changed mnt-sysroot-inactive to an automount. But there
                is no

                way to easily add a udev dependency to the automount. As a
                result,

                when rollbacks tries to access the inactive partition, it fails.

                Let's add systemd-udev-settle.service to the rollback services.


                This will only delay the first boot after a HUP which is
                reasonable.

      body: >
        balenaFin uAP interface needs to be unmanaged by default as
        NetworkManager does

        not support well AP mode. If not added, NetworkManager may try to
        connect to

        defined networks through `uap0` instead of `wlan0`, which is not
        possible.

        In addition to enabling the uap0 interface, two parameters are exposed
        for

        overriding through config.txt.


        `wifi_dbg` could be used for tuning the verbosity of the WiFi driver.


        `wifi_mode` could be used for activating/deactivating WiFi interfaces.
        For

        example `dtparam=wifi_mode=1` will only expose the `wlan0` interface.

        RaspberryPi 4 has different boot firmware from the previous versions

                We have found a rare corner case bug where the journal bloats
                beyond

                its limit and fills the state partition. Triggering a vacuum on
                reboot

                helps a bit in case the device is restarted to recover its
                function.


                Fixes #1423

                Customer reported Huawei E3372 not working
                anymore starting with balenaOS v2.32.
                The fix for this appears to be switching the modem with
                vid and pid 12d1:1f01 from the cdc_ether legacy mode to
                the faster mbim mode and setting mtu=1460 in the modem
                connection file.

                Fix rollback altboots to prevent good reboots by supervisor

                After a HUP, until rollbacks clears its state, the supervisor(or
                user)

                can trigger good reboots. These reboots might be seen by the
                bootloader

                as bad reboots.


                To prevent this from happening, add a service that clears the
                bootcount

                upon good reboots. This only runs if the rollback services have
                not

                cleared their flag files in the state partition.

                U-boot has its own bootcount framework. However, that will
                require

                handling in each device type. We will use u-boot shell commands

                env import -t, env export -t, fatload, fatwrite

                to read/write/increment bootcount in env_resin.h.


                This will allow us to scale to lots of devices.


                A flag os_bootcount_skip is left for devices that are unable to
                support

                fatwrite in u-boot (in some rare cases). This will allow a
                device to

                not support rollback-altboot and still function.


                This patch requires that CMD_SETEXPR be enabled in u-boot config

                options.

                We'd like to enable some options in all boards header files via

                into

                config_default.h (which is included in all board header files).

                We can then add a config option via meta-balena that will be
                enabled for

                all devices.


                This patch enables CONFIG_RESET_TO_RETRY. If for whatever
                strange reason

                (accidental fs issue in u-boot etc), this will trigger a u-boot
                reset

                command the device in 15 seconds.


                Note This requires that the device's u-boot supports the reset
                command

                which it probably should.

                The data partition contains the supervisor which is only about
                61M on

                the pi3. We compress the data partition later on so don't notice
                these

                zeros. But lets reduce the size of the data partition to eat
                less

                space whenever an uncompressed image is used anywhere. e.g. when

                extracting the zip to dd or using balena-migrate etc.


                The partition expands on first boot to fill the rest of the disk

                anyways.

      body: >
        The original version had a reset pin, which does not exist for this
        chipset. The

        related dts property is purged from the source code.


        A `post_power_on` hook is now used instead of `pre_power_on`.
        Specifications

        for all Marvel chips require the PDn pin to be asserted AFTER the chip
        is powered

        on. The original implementation using `pre_power_on` was incorrect.


        The balenaFin device tree overlay is adjusted to be using the patched
        driver.

    - subject: Patches for TCP-based remote denial of service vulnerabilities
      hash: e5d92f9ac7ed96c17680d641f1f7aa034f80eb55
      body: >
        Netflix has identified several TCP networking vulnerabilities

        in FreeBSD and Linux kernels. The vulnerabilities specifically

        relate to the Maximum Segment Size (MSS) and TCP

        Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) capabilities.

        The most serious, dubbed SACK Panic, allows a

        remotely-triggered kernel panic on recent Linux kernels.


        These patches address most of these vulnerabilities.

                This bbclass uses the common layer path advertised by BBLAYERS
                to find

                the paths to different resources in board repository. For
                example

                machine json - to get the slug and advertise it in os-release.
                After

                renaming the common layer (resin to balena) and because we
                support old

                references to the old common layer name (by including a dummy

                deprecation layer), we need to make sure this class can cope now
                with

                both cases.

        The pi-bluetooth gets chained in through
        a dependency in bluetooth, in thud. This dependency
        is defined in bluez5 and matches the machine.
        Currently, the raspberrypi BSP only does it for
        raspberrypi zero wireless and raspberrypi3.
        To adapt this for the balena machine setup (which has
        raspberrypi and raspberrypi zero wireless support in the
        same machine) the same dependency needs to be added.

                This change backports a PR[1] that is already in systemd and

                included by default from the version in Yocto warrior.


                In summary, with this change we fix newer NM which stopped
                handling

                rp_filter when connected to multiple interfaces. See "device:
                disable

                rp_filter handling" commit from NM. Without this change, only
                the

                default route will me usable and binding to a specific interface
                will

                break connectivity if that interface is not also the default
                route for

                the target IP.

                in turn is a tmpfs location. We want this location persistent so
                we can

                save paired devices over reboot. We do that by adding the
                corresponding

                this

                mount unit.

              body: >
                Since 1.29, busybox switched to an internal implementation of
                the

                resolver based on a feature config, NSLOOKUP_BIG. This is
                enabled by

                default and it's meant to be musl compatible. In BalenaOS we use
                glibc

                and we rely on it for being able to resolve names using NSS
                modules

                (libmdns).

                This adds an easier to debug logging that shows both removed and
                kept

                firmwares. For example:

                 Cleaning iwlwifi firmware version 8000C to minimum API version 34.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-13.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-22.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-21.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-31.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-16.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-27.ucode.
                   Leaving iwlwifi-8000C-34.ucode in place.
                   Leaving iwlwifi-8000C-36.ucode in place.

                Also, this commit improves the version comparison which was
                comparing

                strings and not integers. Now we try integer comparison and
                fallback to

                string when parse fails.


                Finally, the task's vardeps expands varflags to correctly
                retrigger on

                change.

                This adds set_os_cmdline which defines os_cmdline so that BSPs

                import it in their bootargs and pass it to kernel accordingly.
                Also, as

                part of os_cmdline, there is an argument added when the booted
                image is

                a flasher. This can be used in the OS for various flasher
                specific

                checks.

                The inactive partition is only needed for HUP or rollbacks. This
                commit

                changes the mnt-sysroot-inactive.service unit to an automount so
                that

                the partition is only mounted when used. This improves boot
                time.

                Since yocto thud, and more specifically since poky switched to

                openssl 1.1 line, the openssl binary is provided by
                'openssl-bin'. On

                that version, 'openssl' doesn't provide this binary making the
                uuid

                generation script fail.


                This patch makes 'openssl-bin' the default dependency but does
                that in a

                way that older yocto versions can overwrite it back to the old
                provider

                (openssl package).

                This PR changes the udev rule to use an absolute path for the

                resin_update_state_probe script. Also it fixes some typos in the
                script

              hash: 9571c572e4abcd1ea5951fa408b1543bc40db8c9

                Since thud, poky distro file on which balena OS is based,
                already

                includes security_flags.inc. Because of this change, this
                version throws

                a build warning similar to:


                WARNING Duplicate inclusion for
                /build/../layers/poky/meta/conf/distro/include/security_flags.inc

                in
                /build/../layers/meta-resin/meta-balena-thud/conf/distro/include/balena-os-yocto-version.inc


                This happens because again, we import `poky` and
                `security_flags` but

                since thud, poky includes security_flags by default. In order to
                avoid

                this warning we import it (security_flags) now using an .inc
                file at the

                level of the yocto version meta-balena layer. There is as well a
                small

                additional wrinkle here. We switch the include statement from
                `require`

                to `include` so new layers (like thud) don't have to carry this
                hack in

                the future.


                This commit prepares meta-balena for thud support.

                The reason for including this version is that balena-engine
                requires

                newer go compiler and also we want to unify it across our
                supported

                yocto versions to avoid eventual possible runtime issues.

                oe-local-files

                directory, we can iterate over those paths instead of relying on
                WORKDIR.

                balenaOS comes in two flavours, production/development.
                production

                images have various options passed to the kernel cmdline.

                Currently some devices BSPs have those options passed and some
                dont.

                It'll be hard to keep the common options consistent.

                e.g. consoleblank=0 is passed for some devices and not for
                others.


                We'd like the extra options we pass to be in one place. All BSPs
                can

                then append this variable in their respective recipe/bootloader
                config

                etc.

                Fix bug where fsck was run on the data partition on every boot
                even if it wasn't needed due to old system time.

                e2fsck by default checks differences between the system time and
                the

                last filesystem mount timestamp.


                As we run on devices without an rtc, and we run the
                filesystem-expand

                service which runs fsck before ntp sync happens, this results in
                errors

                like


                Superblock last mount time (Thu Mar 14 17:13:02 2019,
                      now = Mon Mar 11 15:29:56 2019) is in the future.
                Fix? yes


                This results in fsck running on the data partition on every boot
                which

                slows down the boot time.


                Add e2fsck.conf file with the broken_system_clock flag to
                prevent this

                check from running fsck on every boot. Quite a few distros do
                this as

                well.

              hash: 5da7792e8c85f49fed15488ca983c1252f120d8b
              body: >
                Currently mmc and usb devices are checked at every boot for the
                presence

                of flasher images. USB initialization is slow 1-3 seconds. This
                slows

                boot time significantly.


                Most device types dont need to check for the presence of flasher
                images

                in usb devies. Modify u-boot to only check for mmc devices.


                usb initialization happens in devices via the "usb start"
                command. This

                is usually configured in CONFIG_PREBOOT for devices. Devices
                will need

                to remove "usb start" from CONFIG_PREBOOT to benefit from any
                boot time

                optimization.


                We will need to run "usb start" ourselves via env_resin for any
                device

                that happens to be searching for flasher images in usb device
                types.

                It is best to not create anything in ${B} even if just temporary
                because

                it alters the directory in ways which can break other parts of
                the build

                system. For example, if there is a leftover kernel_source.tar.gz
                in B,

                then the current kernel-devsrc will create a hardlink of this
                file in

                the kernel source tree and then the command:

                tar -czf ${B}/kernel_source.tar.gz -C "$kerneldir/../" .


                will fail like:

                The partition numbers are hex and not integers. This is obvious
                when

                using the jetson family of devices as their partition numbering
                starts

                at 0xc.


                - Change integer comparisons to string comparisons.

                - Convert current_part_idx to hex for a valid string comparison

                From u-boot docs:

                "Almost all U-Boot commands expect numbers to be entered in
                hexadecimal

                input format"


                We only hit this in the jetson family as the boot partition
                there is

                0xc. Add a simple conversion to hex. This should not affect any
                devices

                that use <9 partition numbers. And allow us to use the same hook

                from meta-balena accross all devices. Currently the jetson
                family has

                its own custom hook with this one-liner.

              body: >
                There can be cases where a image type gets invalidated (due to a

                variable change or so) and the dependency of it not. For example
                the img

                type can get invalidated while the hostapp ext3 type doesn't.
                The img

                generatiton script consumes/uses the rootfs generated by the
                hostapp

                type but, it references the artifact based on IMAGE_NAME
                variable which

                includes a time stamp. See bitbake.conf:


                IMAGE_NAME = "${IMAGE_BASENAME}-${MACHINE}-${DATETIME}"


                When that happens, the new timestamp will change and img will
                fail to

                find the old artifact of hostapp. Change this behaviour by using
                the

                symlink reference IMAGE_LINK_NAME which doesn't include a
                timestamp.

        We disable the mmc dtoverlay from config.txt so RevPi Core3 can
        booot.
        If this overlay is enabled u-boot will try to boot OS from a
        different mmc interface.
        Also we disable overlay warnings so the uart interface is silent.
        RevPi Core3 uses this uart interface to communicate with the
        modules on RS485.

                63baa421 introduced a bug where the tools in the header tarballs
                were

                compiled with the incorrect HOSTCC parameter. As a result the
                tools

                inside the tarball were compiled for x86-64 instead of the
                native

                device architecture. And they had the incorrect ld interpreter
                path

                as well.


                Update to v0.0.12 to fix that.

                This release also adds objtool support needed by the intel nuc
                image.

                config.json using `randomMacAddressScan` as the json key.


                config.json snippet example:


                "os": {
                  "network" : {

                We include a set of tests for this tool which are ran at build
                time.

                recipe

                is not in the same directoy as bitbake will not be able to find
                needed

                The label is actually a udev symlink, but we're keeping

                The error seen is that the balena-host service wasn't

                able to start because of a mnt-sysroot-active.service

                By increasing this timeout, the filesystem symlink should

                already exist, at the time the mnt-sysroot-active service is

                looking for this dependency.

        The current integration in uboot uses the ext bootcount driver which
        doesn't use upgrade_available. The entire rollback support design is
        currently based on this variable (upgrade_available) so if that is not
        taken into consideration the board will increment bootcount with every
        boot breaking the board after the first boot. Disable for now this
        feature.

                This patch adds support for translating SSH public keys from
                config.json

                to an authorize_keys file. We use `authorize_keys_local` file as
                the

                destination file of this translation so we can differentiate in
                between keys

                brought locally from config.json and keys brought from the
                balena backend

                through os-config an avoid racing issues with this tool
                (os-config). The final

                `authorize_keys` file will be merged at every ssh connection in
                the dropbear

                service.


                These SSH custom public keys in config.json are assumed to be
                provided

                as an array in `.os.sshKeys`. Example:

                {
                  [...]
                  "os": {
                    "sshKeys": [
                      "ssh-rsa ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",
                      "ssh-rsa 0123456789"
                    ]
                  },
                  [...]

                Replace NM's DHCP request option "Client indentifier" with

                This patch replaces the "Client identifier" option from
                DHCP packets sent by NM to resemble the way udhcpc does it.

                The reason is that the Cisco RV325 router with fw older than
                v1.2.1.14 doesn't reply to DHCP requests or discovery packages
                if the "Client identifier" option is formatted in NM's style.

                Even though this is a bug in the router's fw, we are going to
                fix it here because we encountered clients that couldn't get
                an IP address on these routers and we want to avoid that

                This patch bumps the balena version in meta-resin.


                The update in balena adds support to pass an argument to mobynit
                which

                allows mobynit to mount a rootfs from a custom path.


                The command ./mobynit -sysroot /mnt/sysroot/inactive will mount
                the

                rootfs partition from /mnt/sysroot/inactive and return the
                destination

                path in stdout.

              hash: 3df6e1906e1138a8cd10d15ac3008685b90f75f8
              body: >
                Before multicontainer support in resin, the user container was
                running

                over the host's network stack which means that all the packets
                were

                treated as locally emitted ones. In this case, the communication
                was

                redirected as per the OUTPUT iptable rule only.

                In the "multicontainer world" the user containers run on top of
                bridge

                network which makes the host act as a socksifying router. In
                this case,

                the packets won't go through the OUTPUT chain and the
                redirection to

                redsocks needs to happen at PREROUTING chain.

                This change adds a redirect rule at PREROUTING for TCP packets
                to

                redsocks to redirect packets from the containers to redsocks
                too.


                As well, this adds support for redirecting DNS UDP packets to
                redsocks.

                This is implemented as iptables rules which are only added if
                the

                redsocks configuration has a `dnsu2t` section.

                We would like resin-altboot service to run before balena starts

                resin-altboot checks if the boot configuration is set to run

                resinOS from rootA(B) but we are actually running rootB(A) due
                to

                something.


                If rollback-altboot triggers, it will run hooks to refresh boot
                files

                and reboot. There is no point starting balena in such a device
                state

                as that will only slow down the hooks from running.

                This recipe adds a few systemd services and scripts that handle

                automated OS rollback functionality.


                The rollback-altboot.service checks if we are running in altboot
                mode

                i.e. resinOS_uEnv.txt says we should boot resin_root_part=3. But
                we are

                actually running resinOS from resin_root_part=2. This can happen
                if

                a reboot happened without clearing upgrade_available in
                resinOS_uEnv

                txt file. A kernel panic happened etc.


                The rollback-altboot script runs hostapp-update hooks to change
                the

                bootfiles.


                The rollback-health.service runs rollback-health which checks if
                vpn is

                online and balena is healthy after a hostapp-update.

              body: >
                This patch adds a simple check in env_resin.h.


                If bootcount is found to be greater than bootlimit, switch the

                partitions. Both bootcount and bootlimit are standard u-boot env

                variables.


                To enable rollback in devices, devices have to do the following
                in

                their u-boot


                Enable CONFIG_CMD_SETEXPR, CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_LIMIT and depending
                on the

                device, save the bootcount in some persistant location whether
                that

                is an area in the SoC or an ext partition etc.


                If you are using the CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_EXT driver, use only the
                boot

                partition and use the filename "bootcount.env"


                E.g. for rpi3

                CONFIG_CMD_SETEXPR=y

                CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_LIMIT=y

                CONFIG_SYS_BOOTCOUNT_ADDR=0x02300000

                CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_EXT=y

                CONFIG_SYS_BOOTCOUNT_EXT_DEVPART=0:1

                CONFIG_SYS_BOOTCOUNT_EXT_NAME="bootcount.env"

                Devices that support automated os rollbacks will have two extra

                variables upgrade_available and resin_root_part in their
                grub.cfg

                files.


                Check for the presense of those variables and update them if
                they

                exist.


                Otherwise stick to the previous way of updating grub.cfg


                For devices using grub 2.0, devices will have to mirror the
                pattern

                that exists in u-boot.

                i.e.
                 Add a variable upgrade_available to grub.cfg (HUP hooks update this)
                 Add a variable bootcount to grubenv that increments if
                 upgrade_available is set
                 Add logic in grub.cfg to boot the alternate rootB/A if bootcount
                 reaches 2.

                u-boot uses an upgrade_avaiable flag to update bootcount to
                reduce

                writes to sd card.


                If upgrade_available=0, u-boot won't bother updating the
                bootcount

                variable. During HUP, we'll set upgrade_available=1 so that
                u-boot

                starts counting.


                It'll be the job of the new OS and the rollback services to set

                upgrade_available=0


                For some devices, u-boot will save the bootcount in the boot
                partition

                in /mnt/boot/bootcount.env. Remove that counter when running
                hooks

                fs::read_to_string("libssh2/src/libssh2_config_cmake.h.in")

                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ did you mean `read_string`?


                This is just one example of a package that fails like this.
                There are

                multiple packages in the cargo source tree that fail with this
                error.


                The cargo bbclass does a:

                cargo build -v --target x86_64-linux --release


                This has the following effect:

                NOTE:- cargo build -v --target x86_64-linux --release.

                Updating registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`


                Updating the registry will result in using the versions pinned
                upstream.

                In our case, it will be using newer versions of packages that
                require a

                newer rust version (read_to_string was added in rust 1.26.0).
                But at the

                same time, the meta-rust layer which we use has an older rust
                version.

                (currently meta-rust on sumo branch has rust at version 1.24.1)


                The fix for such a case would be to use a Cargo.lock file which
                pins

                the packages to versions which are known to work with rust
                1.24.1,

                the version we use in sumo.

        We do not have at this point an usecase for delaying the autoboot. In
        addition, we have witnessed a case when an IC connected to uart was
        delaying the autoboot by sending lots of data and thus putting the
        entire autoboot to a halt.

        We also change the stop string to be the ASCII code for Vertical Tab
        and enable the alternate option to stop autoboot by pressing CTRL^C.
        In such a case, the actual viable option to stop autoboot remains
        CTRL^C but u-boot also needs CONFIG_AUTOBOOT_STOP_STR defined for
        CONFIG_AUTOBOOT_KEYED_CTRLC to function correctly so that is why we
        set the stop string to VT.

      body: |
        To enable Automated Rollback support, we have to make u-boot read
        upgrade_available from resinOS_uEnv.txt and we have to make u-boot
        store the bootcount variable in a file called bootcount.env in the
        boot partition.
        The patches do the following
        - Enable the bootcount config options.
        - Add support to the ext bootcount driver to write bootcount
        in the fat partition.
        - u-boot runs altbootcmd if bootlimit is exceeded.
        We handle this manually in env_resin.h where the resin_root_part is
        switched. Hence use the same bootcmd for altbootcmd.

                is contained in the changelog. It will be automatically managed
                by

                versionist by appending the new commits on top. This is needed
                to

                provide nested-changelogs.

      hash: 62deeebb76cd2982f03f475658bee27ff2362af9
      body: |
        Currently, CONFIG_AUTOBOOT_DELAY_STR is set to the space character.
        However, in cases where there is another piece of hardware connected
        to the Pi's UART, it is likely that this connected hardware sends the
        space char, thus putting the autoboot process to a halt. So we change
        this to be the 'pause' string instead to reduce likeliness of an
        accidental delay happening.
